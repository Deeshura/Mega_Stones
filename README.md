# Mega Stones
 Adds Mega Stones and Mega Evolution to PMDO. By using a Mega Stone, your team members can Mega Evolve, becoming stronger until you progress to the next floor. However, each use of a Mega Stone drains your belly somewhat, so be careful!

## TODO
 * Add Mega Stones for all Mega Evolutions. Mega Stones for Mega Evolutions without sprites on spritecollab will be marked as unreleased.
 * Add Mega Stones to the species-exclusive items pool, so players can use them if they have the mod turned on and installe.d
 * Localization
