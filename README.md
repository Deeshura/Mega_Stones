# Mega Stones
 Adds Mega Stones and Mega Evolution to PMDO. By using a Mega Stone, your team members can Mega Evolve, becoming stronger until you progress to the next floor. However, each use of a Mega Stone drains your belly somewhat, so be careful!

 For those looking to obtain these Mega Stones, there's rumors about of a mysterious Pok√©mon seen sneaking into a cave on the outskirts of Overgrown Wilds...

## TODO
 * Localization.
 * Adding in new Mega Stones as they're released.
 * Marking Mega Stones as "released" as new Mega Evolutions recieve sprites.
