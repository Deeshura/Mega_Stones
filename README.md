# Mega Stones
 Adds Mega Stones and Mega Evolution to PMDO. By using a Mega Stone, your team members can Mega Evolve, becoming stronger for a temporary period of time. However, each use of a Mega Stone drains your belly somewhat, so be careful!

## TODO
 * Make it so that *either* you can't transform back by using the item again, or at least doing so doesn't consume hunger like it would when transforming.
 * Refine graphics, adding in the Mega Evolution insignia and changing the lightning to a purple color.
 * Add Mega Stones for all Mega Evolutions. Mega Stones for Mega Evolutions without sprites on spritecollab will be marked as unreleased.
 * Find a way to adjust events for Charizardite X/Y and Mewtwonite X/Y to specifically transform into the corresponding form. Not an issue atm because Charizard Y / Mewtwo X are spriteless (and the code skips unreleased forms), but may be an issue down the line.
 * Add the Red Orb and Blue Orb for Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre(? *maybe* out of scope, will check)
 * Whirlwind kb effect? Will study.
 * Localization
